This repository introduces DSR students to Geometric Deep Learning on graphs. The material has been compiled, using many
different openly available sources, whose list is given below.

### Resources

study book, a course of video lectures, blog posts and videos on the subject.
- [Stanford Machine Learning on Graphs Course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/): The Stanford course, covering many areas
of machine learning on graphs.
- [Graph Representation Learing](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/): A great introductory book on graph neural networks.

- [Relational inductive biases, deep learning, and graph networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261): An amazing DeepMind paper that introduces a general approach for learning on graphs.
- [Geometric Dojo Repository](https://github.com/chaitjo/geometric-gnn-dojo): A repo with a practical assignment for the students of a
Cambridge Master's program for Representation Learning on Graphs.
- [E(n) Equivariant Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09844): A paper that introduces E(n) equivariant GNNs, extending
the notion of SO(3) equivariance.
- [PointNet++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02413): A pioneering paper, introducing the way to use GNNs with point clouds.
- [Pytorch Geometric](https://www.pyg.org/): One of the best libraries for working with graphs.
